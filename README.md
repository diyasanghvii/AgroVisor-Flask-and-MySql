# AgroVisor-Flask-and-MySql
Built an e-commerce web application to provide a platform for farmers to buy and sell produce/products using Flask, HTML, CSS, and MySQL.  
This application is aimed at saving time and energy. It is estimated to increase profits by 5% and allows farmers having financial troubles to buy products at 10-20% conditional subsidy.
